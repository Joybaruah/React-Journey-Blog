        So I've been really struggling with CSS -_- . have been working on my
        Blog website which you are reading..
        <br />
        <p>
          To be honest at some i really mess up things and don’t get what the
          shit im doing.. Maybe thats what developers go through buttt when you
          solve what you messed up thats what the thing keeps you motivated and
          i think thats what we Developers live for xD anyways.,
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Also learnt new stuff about react hooks and that's all for today,, see
          yaa
